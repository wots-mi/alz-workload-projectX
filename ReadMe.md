Azure APIM and App Service Environment v3 Landing Zone Accelerator (ALZ)
=======================================================================

APIs are at the core of how modern organisations deliver and consume digital servicesâ€”internally across business units, and externally to partners, customers, and developers. Internally, APIs enable secure access to line-of-business systems, custom-built solutions, and third-party services, often built using Azure PaaS offerings like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Azure App Services.

For organisations with stringent compliance, network isolation, and high-scale hosting requirements, APIs are frequently deployed into an Azure App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3). ASEv3 is a fully isolated, highly scalable, single-tenant App Service offering that runs within a customerâ€™s Azure Virtual Network. It supports internal load balancing, private IP addresses, custom domain names, and fine-grained network security, making it ideal for hosting mission-critical APIs and applications that must not be exposed to the public internet.

As the use of APIs continues to grow, so does the need for centralized governance, security, and lifecycle management. This is where Azure API Management (APIM) becomes essential. It acts as a unified gateway to manage, secure, and publish APIsâ€”regardless of whether they are hosted in Azure App Services, ASEv3, Functions, or Logic Apps. With APIM, developers and administrators can apply consistent policies, rate limits, and authentication mechanisms across all APIs.

To enhance global performance, availability, and security, Azure Front Door can be placed in front of API Management. Azure Front Door offers a globally distributed, highly available edge platform that provides features such as anycast routing, SSL termination, Web Application Firewall (WAF), URL-based routing, and caching. This combination ensures that both internal and external APIs are delivered reliably and securelyâ€”regardless of where the backend is hosted.

When integrated together:

  - APIs hosted in ASEv3 can remain private, accessed only through APIM and Front Door.

  - Azure API Management acts as the control plane, enforcing policies and enabling visibility.

  - Azure Front Door serves as the global entry point, enforcing edge security and optimising traffic.


Architecture
-------------

This architecture empowers organisations to deliver secure, scalable, and compliant APIs to both internal and external consumers, while maintaining centralised governance and enterprise-grade security. It is designed to be deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices, enabling rapid and consistent deployment across multiple environments.

## Optional: Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

You can optionally deploy a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** policy and associate it with the frontend of **Azure Front Door** to protect **API Management** from malicious attacks.

The WAF policy uses the **OWASP default rule set** for protection.

Securing API Management with Azure Front Door and NSG Rules
---
When API Management is deployed in a virtual network and configured to use the external access type, the API Gateway and Developer Portal remain accessible from the public internet via an external load balancer, while still allowing the API Gateway to access resources within the VNet.
To force client applications to invoke the API Gateway exclusively through Azure Front Door, follow these steps:

<u>Restrict API Management access to Azure Front Door:</u>


  - Configure an inbound rule in the Network Security Group (NSG) associated with the subnet hosting API Management.

  - Allow inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 (HTTP/HTTPS) only from the AzureFrontDoor.Backend service tag.

  - This configuration ensures that:

    1.  The public endpoints of API Management (including the Gateway and Developer Portal) only accept traffic routed through Azure Front Door.

    2. Direct internet access to APIM endpoints is effectively blocked.

 
ðŸ“˜ [Tutorial: How do I lock down the access to my backend to only Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-faq)

<u>Accessing the API Management Developer Portal</u>
- If users need access to the API Management Developer Portal, you have two options:
1. Allow IP Ranges:
    - Create an additional NSG rule to allow traffic on ports 80/443 from a specific range of trusted public IP addresses (e.g., corporate networks).
2. Use the Self-Hosted Developer Portal:
    - Deploy the self-hosted developer portal either on-premises or in the cloud (e.g., on an Azure VM).
    - Then, configure an NSG rule on the API Management subnet to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic only from the IP address of the server/VM hosting the portal.
